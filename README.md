# FinancesPi
This is a small personal project to help me automize my finances.

## Summary
This program will gather my monthly expenses, sort them and store them in a database.

## Step by Step
1. The program will go through the emails I've received from the bank (Defined by the email query) and collect every monthly extract (pdf document).
2. It will mine the pdfs for the data. (About 80% accuracy on each line).
3. Store the expenses, incomes, where the money went or came from, etc. in a database.
